Your devices. Your internet speed heavily depends on your network equipment (router). Old devices. Your devices’ hardware – processor, network card, memory, etc. – can impact the speed.

If you are using an old router, consider upgrading it; an old router, or a router that is not designed to go as fast as your package, can slow down your Wi-Fi speed. Devices location. If your Wi-Fi router is located far from the devices, your internet speed will not be ideal; you may need a wireless repeater to boost the signal. Physical obstacles placed between the router and devices, especially walls and metal, can reduce Wi-Fi speed; move away metal boards, if any, and aquariums. Viruses. Viruses or malware might be running in the background, connecting to the internet and draining your network’s resources; take precautions by installing an antivirus programme and perform regular scans.

Full Home Wi-Fi is a new solution to support customers extend their internet wi-fi coverage across their home, be it villa or apartments.
